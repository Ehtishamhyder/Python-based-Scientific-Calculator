           Scientific Calculator

**Overview:**
This is a Python-based Scientific Calculator developed using Visual Studio Code.
The program performs 13 important mathematical operations including arithmetic,
trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, power, square root, and factorial functions.

**Features:**
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
> Sine, Cosine, Tangent
> Logarithm & Natural Logarithm
> Exponential & Power
> Square Root
> Factorial

Concepts Applied:
In this project, I extensively used Python's math library to implement
scientific functions. Conditional statements (if-elif-else) are used to
handle multiple operations efficiently. The time.sleep() function is
implemented to improve user interaction and program flow. I used time.sleep() function for 3 seconds. Its mean mean next flow show after 3 seconds.

Run on Python to get Benefit:
Run the program using:
python filename.py

handle multiple operations efficiently. The `time.sleep()` function is  
implemented to improve user interaction and program flow. I used `time.sleep(3)`  
to delay the next flow by 3 seconds.
