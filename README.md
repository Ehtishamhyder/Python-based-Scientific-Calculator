# Scientific Calculator

**Overview:**  
This is a Python-based Scientific Calculator developed using Visual Studio Code.  
The program performs 13 important mathematical operations including arithmetic,  
trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, power, square root, and factorial functions.

**Features:**  
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- Sine, Cosine, Tangent  
- Logarithm & Natural Logarithm  
- Exponential & Power  
- Square Root  
- Factorial

**Concepts Applied:**  
In this project, I extensively used Python's math library to implement  
scientific functions. Conditional statements (if-elif-else) are used to  
handle multiple operations efficiently. The `time.sleep()` function is  
implemented to improve user interaction and program flow. I used `time.sleep(3)`  
to delay the next flow by 3 seconds.

**Run on Python to get Benefit:**  
Run the program using:  
```bash
python filename.py
