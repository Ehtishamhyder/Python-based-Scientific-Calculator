Scientific Calculator (Python)

Overview:
This is a Python-based Scientific Calculator developed using Visual Studio Code.
The program performs 13 important mathematical operations including arithmetic,
trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, power, square root, and factorial functions.

Features:
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Sine, Cosine, Tangent
- Logarithm & Natural Logarithm
- Exponential & Power
- Square Root
- Factorial
- Menu-driven interface

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Python Math Library
- if, elif, else statements
- time.sleep() function

Concepts Applied:
In this project, I extensively used Python's math library to implement
scientific functions. Conditional statements (if-elif-else) are used to
handle multiple operations efficiently. The time.sleep() function is
implemented to improve user interaction and program flow.

Purpose:
This project is specially designed for students and beginners to understand
how mathematical operations are implemented using Python. It demonstrates
logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and structured coding practices.
