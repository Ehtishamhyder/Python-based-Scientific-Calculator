Scientific Calculator (Python)
Overview

This is a Python-based Scientific Calculator developed using Visual Studio Code. The program performs 13 important mathematical operations including arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, power, square root, and factorial functions.

Features

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Sine, Cosine, Tangent

Logarithm & Natural Logarithm

Exponential & Power

Square Root

Factorial

Menu-driven interface

Technologies Used

Python

Python Math Library

if, elif, else statements

time.sleep() function

Concepts Applied

In this project, I extensively used Python’s math library to implement scientific functions. Conditional statements (if-elif-else) are used to handle multiple operations efficiently. The time.sleep() function is used to improve user interaction and program flow.

Purpose

This project is designed for students and beginners to understand how mathematical operations are implemented using Python programming. It demonstrates logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and structured coding practices.
